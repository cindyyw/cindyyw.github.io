			<h1>How are distributed bugs diagnosed and fixed?</h1>
			<h2>What is distributed bug?</h2>
			<p>We consider a bug to be <I>distributed</I>, if its error propagation, which starts from the initial fault and ends at a system failure, involves more than one node
				</p>

			<h2>A Distributed Bug Example</h2>
			<img src="./images/Dbug-example.png" width="370" height="190"  style="position:relative;top:24px;left:130px;" />
			<p style="line-height:30px;"><br/><br/>
				The above figure illustrates a real-word distributed bug <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5488">MAPREDUCE-5488</a> from MapReduce. <br/>
				In this bug: 
				<br/>(1) An application is submitted to ResourceManager (RM); 
				<br/>(2) The application gets executed by an ApplicationMaster (AM);
				<br/>(3) The application status on AM will be periodically polled by its owner client. 
				<br/>At some point when the AM crashes, both the RM and the client will learn that. 
				<br/>(4) The RM will launch a new AM on another node to recover and continue the application; 
				<br/>(5) The client will obtain the address of the new AM from the RM. Unfortunately, sometimes the client may get the old AM's address, if the new AM's launching is unexpectedly slow. 
				<br/>As a result, the client will fail to connect to the AM, and report application failure in its log, even though the application is successfully completed by the new AM.
